## Leigh Ryffel

🔬 Former Science Teacher 🏐 Volleyballer 🌳 Hiker 🤔 Crossword Puzzle Constructor 🏓 Pickleball Enthusiast

### About Me
I'm a full-stack Software Engineer experienced in JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, React.js, HTML, CSS, and SQL. My career has taken me from teaching high school science to developing computer science curriculum, and I've now fully transitioned to web development with a passion for creating products that engage and delight users. I'm excited about work that promotes equity in education and supports teachers and students. I'd love to connect with people and organizations who are similarly committed to advancing outcomes for women and minorities in tech.

### Currently Working On...
 - a homepage for my meme-themed newsletter over at [memeoftheweek.net](https://memeoftheweek.net)
 - refining my [Harry Styles fan page](https://www.loom.com/share/556b2de35ec14ed5ab940b342283143c) (will work on this until he notices me!)

When I'm not building web applications, you can find me in Brooklyn playing volleyball or pickleball, solving crossword puzzles, or planning my next visit to a National Park. Have a project in mind? Let's connect!
